AI assistants can be incredibly useful for drafting emails, planning a trip, or just satisfying a random curiosity, but there’s always that nagging feeling that every question you ask, every idea you explore, is being logged, analysed, and fed back into a massive corporate machine. You’re constantly trading a bit of your privacy for a bit of convenience.
Lumo is now a whole lot smarter. Proton is calling it version 1.1, and the main takeaway is the AI assistant is better at pretty much everything. It’s faster, it gives more detailed answers, and it’s much more up-to-date on what’s happening in the world.
For specific metrics, Proton is claiming a 200% improvement in Lumo’s ability to ‘reason’ through complex problems—you know, the tricky multi-step stuff where other AIs tend to get lost. On top of that, Proton says their AI assistant is now 170% better at actually understanding the context of what you’re asking, and for the coders out there, it’s seen a 40% boost in generating correct code.
But here’s the part that really matters: it does all of this without snooping on you.
Unlike the big players, Proton’s entire approach to AI is built around privacy. When you chat with most AIs, you’re essentially having a conversation in a room full of people taking notes. With Lumo, you’re in a locked room, and only you have the key. Your conversations are encrypted in such a way that nobody at Proton can ever read them. They don’t save your chats, and they don’t use your personal conversations to train their AI.
To prove their privacy claims, Proton has made the code for their AI assistant’s mobile apps open-source. That means Proton is letting anyone look under the bonnet to check that Lumo’s engine is running the way they claim it is. It’s about building trust, not just demanding it.
So, what’s the catch?

For the first time in decades, Taiwan’s manufacturing titans are watching their bread-and-butter consumer electronics businesses get overtaken by artificial intelligence infrastructure – a shift that’s rewriting the playbook for an industry that was built on assembling the world’s smartphones and laptops.
What took Apple nearly two decades to build, AI servers have displaced in less than three years, signalling an inflexion point that companies like Foxconn are navigating actively, diversifying beyond traditional consumer electronics.
The scale of Taiwan’s server dominance
Taiwan’s commanding position in global server manufacturing has positioned it perfectly for the AI boom, with the island accounting for over 90% of global AI server builds and approximately 80% of all server shipments worldwide. Its dominance stems from decades of expertise in electronics manufacturing, originally developed through the notebook computer industry, since evolved into an important advantage in the age of artificial intelligence.
According to statistics released by Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs in October 2024, the island’s server production value from January to July 2024 reached NT$426.7 billion (approximately US$13.2 billion) in value, in seven months surpassing the total value for 2023 and representing an annual growth rate of 153.9%.
Major players experience revenue surges
The impact of AI servers on Taiwan’s manufacturing giants has been nothing short of transformational. Nvidia partner Wistron’s revenue for January to July rose 92.7%, while Quanta’s grew 65.6% in the same period. The numbers reflect a broader trend affecting the entire ecosystem of Taiwan’s original design manufacturers (ODMs).

Among those losing value were Palantir, down 9.4% and Arm Holdings down 5%. According to the Financial Times [paywall], Tuesday saw the biggest one-day fall in the market since the beginning of August.
Some traders put the falls down to a report released [PDF] by an AI company, NANDA, which noted the high failure rate of many generative AI projects in commercial organisations. Project NANDA originated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab and describes itself as an organisation that’s building an “agentic web.” The paper has, since publication, been placed behind a survey wall, but is available for download from this site.
The research authors state only 5% of gen AI pilots reach production and actually produce measurable monetary value, with the vast majority of projects creating little impact on profit & loss metrics. The research undertaken by NANDA comprised of the content of 52 structured interviews with enterprise decision-makers, researchers’ analysis of 300+ public AI initiatives and announcements, and a survey questionnaire completed by 153 company leaders. It measured return on investment over six months after gen AI projects left pilot status.
While many organisations deploy AI in front-office or customer-facing business functions, successful projects tend to be found among back-office workflows, the paper says. It’s in the mundane tasks of the back office where savings are accrued, largely from a lowered need for third-party agencies and BPOs. The survey found there was little impact by AI projects on overall internal staff levels.
While 90% of staff stated they have personally benefited from using publicly-available AIs, typically in the form of large language models like ChatGPT, those subjective gains are not translated at institution level. Around 40% of the companies surveyed pay for a subscription to LLMs', 'The article reports that a study by the NANDA research group found that only 5% of generative AI projects in commercial organizations actually produce measurable financial value, with the majority of such projects having little impact on profit and loss metrics.

At its Security Summit 2025, Google laid out its vision for a future where AI frees up human security experts from tedious work to focus on what matters most.
The central idea is to use AI to defend your organisation while securing your own AI initiatives from attack. As businesses increasingly rely on AI agents, these agents themselves become a new frontier for security concerns.
Securing the AI ecosystem
Before AI can become a trusted defender, its own environment must be secure. To this end, Google Cloud is enhancing its AI Protection solution within the Security Command Center.
New capabilities, arriving soon in preview, will automatically discover all the AI agents and servers in your environment. This will give security teams a clear view of their entire AI agent ecosystem, helping them to spot vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and risky interactions.
Real-time protection is also getting a boost. Model Armor’s in-line protection is being extended to prompts and responses within Agentspace, helping to block threats like prompt injection and data leaks as they happen.
To ensure AI agents are always playing by the rules, new posture controls will help them stick to company security policies. And with new threat detections powered by intelligence from Mandiant and Google Cloud, security teams can now better spot and respond to unusual or suspicious behaviour from their AI assets.
Rise of the agentic SOC
Perhaps the most forward-looking announcement is Google’s vision for an “agentic security operations centre (SOC)”. Imagine a system where AI agents collaborate to manage threats, automate alert investigations, and even help engineers create new detections to fill security gaps.
The first step in this direction is the new Alert Investigation agent, which is now in preview. This tool acts like a junior analyst, autonomously looking into security events, ana', 'The article discusses Google Cloud''s vision for using AI to help security teams by automatically discovering and securing AI agents within an organization''s environment.

AI offers a classic double-edged sword: a powerful shield for defenders and a potent new tool for those with malicious intent. Navigating this complex battleground requires a steady hand and a deep understanding of both the technology and the people who would abuse it.
To get a view from the front lines, AI News caught up with Rachel James, Principal AI ML Threat Intelligence Engineer at global biopharmaceutical company AbbVie.

“In addition to the built in AI augmentation that has been vendor-provided in our current tools, we also use LLM analysis on our detections, observations, correlations and associated rules,” James explains.
James and her team are using large language models to sift through a mountain of security alerts, looking for patterns, spotting duplicates, and finding dangerous gaps in their defences before an attacker can.
“We use this to determine similarity, duplication and provide gap analysis,” she adds, noting that the next step is to weave in even more external threat data. “We are looking to enhance this with the integration of threat intelligence in our next phase.”
Central to this operation is a specialised threat intelligence platform called OpenCTI, which helps them build a unified picture of threats from a sea of digital noise.
AI is the engine that makes this cybersecurity effort possible, taking vast quantities of jumbled, unstructured text and neatly organising it into a standard format known as STIX. The grand vision, James says, is to use language models to connect this core intelligence with all other areas of their security operation, from vulnerability management to third-party risk.
Taking advantage of this power, however, comes with a healthy dose of caution. As a key contributor to a major industry initiative, James is acutely aware of the pitfalls.

But the latest Gartner Magic Quadrant for Container Management 2025 positions Huawei in the Leaders quadrant for the first time. Huawei Cloud is a company that’s quietly making inroads into enterprise mindsets all over the world, and innovating – especially with AI-related workloads – despite the best efforts of the current US government to stymie global competition in the space.
Huawei Cloud scored the highest global customer recognition score (4.7) of the companies in Gartner’s paper, beating fellow Chinese behemoths Tencent and Alibaba, plus the ‘big three’ of AWS, Google GCP and Microsoft Azure.
According to Gartner, Huawei Cloud offers the most complete container product matrix in the cloud industry, where its platforms can be found in public, distributed, and hybrid clouds, and edge environments.
The company’s big wins in terms of clients and users get little coverage in the US and Europe, but it’s proving an effective provider for companies like media service Starzplay (which streamed the 2024 Cricket World Cup across the Middle East and Central Asia) and logistics giant Ninja Van in Singapore.
South America and Africa, too, have been the scene of several successes for the Chinese company, notably Nigeria’s e-commerce platform Konga, which uses a cloud native architecture based on Huawei Cloud’s CCT Turbo, and major power utility Chilquina Energia in Chile.

The conference is the brainchild of Stanford computer scientist James Zou, who studies how humans and AI can best work together. Artificial intelligence has already provided many useful tools for scientists, like DeepMind’s AlphaFold, which helps simulate proteins that are difficult to make physically. More recently, though, progress in large language models and reasoning-enabled AI has advanced the idea that AI can work more or less as autonomously as scientists themselves—proposing hypotheses, running simulations, and designing experiments on their own.

That idea is not without its detractors. Among other issues, many feel AI is not capable of the creative thought needed in research, makes too many mistakes and hallucinations, and may limit opportunities for young researchers. 
Nevertheless, a number of scientists and policymakers are very keen on the promise of AI scientists. The US government’s AI Action Plan describes the need to “invest in automated cloud-enabled labs for a range of scientific fields.” Some researchers think AI scientists could unlock scientific discoveries that humans could never find alone. For Zou, the proposition is simple: “AI agents are not limited in time. They could actually meet with us and work with us 24/7.” 
Last month, Zou published an article in Nature with results obtained from his own group of autonomous AI workers. Spurred on by his success, he now wants to see what other AI scientists (that is, scientists that are AI) can accomplish.

The company also provided average estimates for the water consumption and carbon emissions associated with a text prompt to Gemini.
It’s the most transparent estimate yet from a Big Tech company with a popular AI product, and the report includes detailed information about how the company calculated its final estimate. As AI has become more widely adopted, there’s been a growing effort to understand its energy use. But public efforts attempting to directly measure the energy used by AI have been hampered by a lack of full access to the operations of a major tech company. 
Earlier this year, MIT Technology Review published a comprehensive series on AI and energy, at which time none of the major AI companies would reveal their per-prompt energy usage. Google’s new publication, at last, allows for a peek behind the curtain that researchers and analysts have long hoped for.
The study focuses on a broad look at energy demand, including not only the power used by the AI chips that run models but also by all the other infrastructure needed to support that hardware. 
“We wanted to be quite comprehensive in all the things we included,” said Jeff Dean, Google’s chief scientist, in an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review about the new report.
That’s significant, because in this measurement, the AI chips—in this case, Google’s custom TPUs, the company’s proprietary equivalent of GPUs—account for just 58% of the total electricity demand of 0.24 watt-hours.

It’s a serious question, and it’s one that Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, has clearly been chewing on since GPT-5’s bumpy launch at the start of the month. 
He faces a trilemma. Should ChatGPT flatter us, at the risk of fueling delusions that can spiral out of hand? Or fix us, which requires us to believe AI can be a therapist despite the evidence to the contrary? Or should it inform us with cold, to-the-point responses that may leave users bored and less likely to stay engaged? 
It’s safe to say the company has failed to pick a lane. 
Back in April, it reversed a design update after people complained ChatGPT had turned into a suck-up, showering them with glib compliments. GPT-5, released on August 7, was meant to be a bit colder. Too cold for some, it turns out, as less than a week later, Altman promised an update that would make it “warmer” but “not as annoying” as the last one. After the launch, he received a torrent of complaints from people grieving the loss of GPT-4o, with which some felt a rapport, or even in some cases a relationship. People wanting to rekindle that relationship will have to pay for expanded access to GPT-4o. (Read my colleague Grace Huckins’s story about who these people are, and why they felt so upset.)
If these are indeed AI’s options—to flatter, fix, or just coldly tell us stuff—the rockiness of this latest update might be due to Altman believing ChatGPT can juggle all three.
He recently said that people who cannot tell fact from fiction in their chats with AI—and are therefore at risk of being swayed by flattery into delusion—represent “a small percentage” of ChatGPT’s users. He said the same for people who have romantic relationships with AI. Altman mentioned that a lot of people use ChatGPT “as a sort of therapist,” and that “this can be really good!” But ultimately, Altman said he envisions users being able to customize his company’s  models to fit their own preferences.

Skinner led his own secret government project to win World War II. 
Skinner did not aim to build a new class of larger, more destructive weapons. Rather, he wanted to make conventional bombs more precise. The idea struck him as he gazed out the window of his train on the way to an academic conference. “I saw a flock of birds lifting and wheeling in formation as they flew alongside the train,” he wrote. “Suddenly I saw them as ‘devices’ with excellent vision and maneuverability. Could they not guide a missile?”
Skinner started his missile research with crows, but the brainy black birds proved intractable. So he went to a local shop that sold pigeons to Chinese restaurants, and “Project Pigeon” was born. Though ordinary pigeons, Columba livia, were no one’s idea of clever animals, they proved remarkably cooperative subjects in the lab. Skinner rewarded the birds with food for pecking at the right target on aerial photographs—and eventually planned to strap the birds into a device in the nose of a warhead, which they would steer by pecking at the target on a live image projected through a lens onto a screen. 
The military never deployed Skinner’s kamikaze pigeons, but his experiments convinced him that the pigeon was “an extremely reliable instrument” for studying the underlying processes of learning. “We have used pigeons, not because the pigeon is an intelligent bird, but because it is a practical one and can be made into a machine,” he said in 1944.
People looking for precursors to artificial intelligence often point to science fiction by authors like Isaac Asimov or thought experiments like the Turing test.

The Norwegian student was enjoying a late-night writing session last Thursday when her ChatGPT collaborator started acting strange. “It started forgetting everything, and it wrote really badly,” she says. “It was like a robot.”
June, who asked that we use only her first name for privacy reasons, first began using ChatGPT for help with her schoolwork. But she eventually realized that the service—and especially its 4o model, which seemed particularly attuned to users’ emotions—could do much more than solve math problems. It wrote stories with her, helped her navigate her chronic illness, and was never too busy to respond to her messages.
So the sudden switch to GPT-5 last week, and the simultaneous loss of 4o, came as a shock. “I was really frustrated at first, and then I got really sad,” June says. “I didn’t know I was that attached to 4o.” She was upset enough to comment, on a Reddit AMA hosted by CEO Sam Altman and other OpenAI employees, “GPT-5 is wearing the skin of my dead friend.”June was just one of a number of people who reacted with shock, frustration, sadness, or anger to 4o’s sudden disappearance from ChatGPT. Despite its previous warnings that people might develop emotional bonds with the model, OpenAI appears to have been caught flat-footed by the fervor of users’ pleas for its return. Within a day, the company made 4o available again to its paying customers (free users are stuck with GPT-5). 
OpenAI’s decision to replace 4o with the more straightforward GPT-5 follows a steady drumbeat of news about the potentially harmful effects of extensive chatbot use. Reports of incidents in which ChatGPT sparked psychosis in users have been everywhere for the past few months, and in a blog post last week, OpenAI acknowledged 4o’s failure to recognize when users were experiencing delusions.

While these models appear to capture the essence of human intelligence, they defy even our most basic intuitions about it. They have emerged not because they are thoughtful solutions to the problem of intelligence, but because they scaled effectively on hardware we already had. Seduced by the fruits of scale, some have come to believe that it provides a clear pathway to AGI. The most emblematic case of this is the multimodal approach, in which massive modular networks are optimized for an array of modalities that, taken together, appear general. However, I argue that this strategy is sure to fail in the near term; it will not lead to human-level AGI that can, e.g., perform sensorimotor reasoning, motion planning, and social coordination. Instead of trying to glue modalities together into a patchwork AGI, we should pursue approaches to intelligence that treat embodiment and interaction with the environment as primary, and see modality-centered processing as emergent phenomena.Preface: Disembodied definitions of Artificial General Intelligence — emphasis on general — exclude crucial problem spaces that we should expect AGI to be able to solve. A true AGI must be general across all domains. Any complete definition must at least include the ability to solve problems that originate in physical reality, e.g. repairing a car, untying a knot, preparing food, etc. As I will discuss in the next section, what is needed for these problems is a form of intelligence that is fundamentally situated in something like a physical world model.

Mathematics and statistics, once the primary guides of machine learning research, now struggle to provide immediate insight into the latest breakthroughs. This is not the first time that empirical progress in machine learning has outpaced more theory-motivated approaches, yet the magnitude of recent advances has forced us to swallow the bitter pill of the “Bitter Lesson” yet again [1].This shift has prompted speculation about mathematics’ diminished role in machine learning research moving forward. It is already evident that mathematics will have to share the stage with a broader range of perspectives (for instance, biology which has deep experience drawing conclusions about irreducibly complex systems or the social sciences as AI is integrated ever more deeply into society). The increasingly interdisciplinary nature of machine learning should be welcomed as a positive development by all researchers.However, we argue that mathematics remains as relevant as ever; its role is simply evolving. For example, whereas mathematics might once have primarily provided theoretical guarantees on model performance, it may soon be more commonly used for post-hoc explanations of empirical phenomena observed in model training and performance–a role analogous to one that it plays in physics.

If we envision a future of human-AI collaboration rather than AI replacing humans, the current ways of measuring dialogue systems may be insufficient because they measure in a non-interactive fashion.Why does purposeful dialogue matter?Purposeful dialogue refers to a multi-round user-chatbot conversation that centers around a goal or intention. The goal could range from a generic one like “harmless and helpful” to more specific roles like “travel planning agent”, “psycho-therapist” or “customer service bot.”Travel planning is a simple, illustrative example. Our preferences, fellow travelers’ preference, and all the complexities of real-world situations make transmitting all information in one pass way too costly. However, if multiple back-and-forth exchanges of information are allowed, only important information gets selectively exchanged. Negotiation theory offers an analogy of this—iterative bargaining yields better outcomes than a take-it-or-leave-it offer. In fact, sharing information is only one aspect of dialogue. In Terry Winograd’s words: “All language use can be thought of as a way of activating procedures within the hearer.” We can think of each utterance as a deliberate action that one party takes to alter the world model of the other. What if both parties have more complicated, even hidden goals? In this way, purposeful dialogue provides us with a way of formulating human-AI interactions as a collaborative game, where the goal of chatbot is to help humans achieve certain goals.

Thus it’s no surprise that so many conversations these days circle around an era-defining question: How do we ensure AI benefits humanity? These conversations often devolve into strident optimism or pessimism about AI, and our earnest aim is to walk a pragmatic middle path, though no doubt we will not perfectly succeed.While it’s fashionable to handwave towards “beneficial AI,” and many of us want to contribute towards its development — it’s not easy to pin down what beneficial AI concretely means in practice.

Transformational consumer products like ChatGPT are powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that excel at modeling sequences of tokens that represent words or parts of words [2]. Amazingly, structural understanding emerges from learning next-token prediction, and agents are able to complete tasks such as translation, question answering and generating human-like prose from simple user prompts.Not surprisingly, quantitative traders have asked: can we turn these models into the next price or trade prediction [1,9,10]? That is, rather than modeling sequences of words, can we model sequences of prices or trades. This turns out to be an interesting line of inquiry that reveals much about both generative AI and financial time series modeling. Be warned this will get wonky.LLMs are known as autoregressive learners -- those using previous tokens or elements in a sequence to predict the next element or token. In quantitative trading, for example in strategies like statistical arbitrage in stocks, most research is concerned with identifying autoregressive structure.

Traditional development cycles, where it takes months of planning before anything ships, don’t work in the era of generative AI. New capabilities surface every week, and ideas lose momentum unless you put a prototype in front of people fast.

Our new course, Fast Prototyping of GenAI Apps with Streamlit, built in partnership with Snowflake and led by Chanin Nantasenamat, helps you work around this shift. You’ll learn a repeatable workflow to go from idea to share-ready demo software in days, not months. 

You’ll start with a simple chatbot, then add prompt engineering and RAG powered by Snowflake’s secure data and LLM services, and push your prototype to Snowflake or Streamlit Community Cloud for instant feedback and rapid improvement.

In detail, you’ll: 

- Build an interactive Streamlit analytics assistant that mines a customer-review dataset for sentiment insights within your own Snowflake account (120-day free trial included).
- Improve response quality with structured prompt engineering and RAG, grounding each answer in the review data.
- Ship your prototype to internal Snowflake workspaces, or publish it to Streamlit Community Cloud, gather feedback, and iterate fast with the course’s MVP playbook.

Start building and iterating GenAI apps fast.

LLMs naturally provide free-form text responses, which works for unstructured generation, such as article summaries or brainstorming exercises. However, when you''re building an LLM into a larger software system, in which you want to pass data from an LLM response to the next component of the system in a predictable way, that''s when structured output can be a big help.

In this course, you’ll learn to move beyond free-form LLM responses and generate structured outputs that are easier to process and connect to other tools.

You’ll begin by understanding what structured output is and why it matters when building applications that use LLMs. Through the example of a customer support assistant, you’ll learn different methods of using Pydantic to ensure an LLM gives you the expected data and format you need in your application. These methods ensure that the LLM’s responses are complete, correctly formatted, and ready to use, whether that means creating support tickets, triggering tools, or routing requests.

Throughout the course, you’ll gain core data validation skills that can be helpful in any software system you build, where you want to pass data from one component to the next. You’ll also learn how modern frameworks and LLM providers support structured outputs and function calls using Pydantic under the hood.

In detail, you’ll:

- Learn the basics of Pydantic, and practice different approaches for getting structured data from Pydantic models.
- Validate user input, catching issues like badly formatted emails or missing fields before they cause problems.
- Use Pydantic data models directly in your API calls to different LLM providers and agent frameworks as a re', 'This video provides an introduction to the Pydantic library, a Python tool for data validation, and how it can be used to bring structure, reliability, and validation to the data in LLM-powered applications.

Before a large language model can follow instructions, it undergoes two key stages: pre-training and post-training. In pre-training, it learns to predict the next word or token from large amounts of unlabeled text. In post-training, it learns useful behaviors such as following instructions, tool use, and reasoning.

In our latest short course, Post-training of LLMs, you’ll learn how to use three of the most common post-training techniques: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Online Reinforcement Learning (RL), to reshape model behavior for specific tasks or capabilities.

Taught by Banghua Zhu, Assistant Professor at the University of Washington, Principal Research Scientist at Nvidia, and co-founder of NexusFlow, this course covers:

- When to apply post-training and how it compares to pre-training
- How to curate and structure training data for each method
- How to use SFT to turn a base model into an instruct model
- How contrastive learning in DPO improves output quality
- How to design reward functions for RL tasks like math or code
- How to evaluate whether post-training improved or degraded model behavior

You’ll also get hands-on experience implementing each technique with Hugging Face’s TRL library to:

- Fine-tune a base model into an instruction-following assistant
- Modify a model’s responses using preferred and rejected examples
- Improve a model’s reasoning with online RL and verifiable rewards

Introducing ACP: Agent Communication Protocol, a short course built in partnership with IBM Research’s BeeAI and taught by Sandi Besen, AI Research Engineer & Ecosystem Lead at IBM, and Nicholas Renotte, Head of AI Developer Advocacy at IBM.

Building a multi-agent system with agents shared across teams and organizations can be challenging. You may need to write custom integrations each time a team updates their agent design or changes the agent''s framework. The Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) is an open protocol that addresses this challenge by standardizing communication between agents. It provides a unified interface through which agents can collaborate regardless of their frameworks, making it easy to replace an agent with a new version without needing to refactor the entire system.

In this course, you’ll learn to connect agents through ACP. The protocol is based on a client-server architecture: you host an agent built with any framework inside an ACP server, and send requests to the server through an ACP client. You’ll learn how to wrap an agent inside an ACP server and set up an ACP client to connect to the server. You’ll build sequential and hierarchical workflows of agents hosted inside ACP servers, and learn how to manage this workflow on the client side through a process or another agent. 

By the end of the course, you’ll know how to create ACP-compliant agents that can communicate regardless of their frameworks and collaborate to address queries.

Introducing Building with Llama 4, a short course, created in collaboration with Meta and taught by Amit Sangani, Director of Partner Engineering for Meta’s AI team.

Meta’s new Llama 4 has added three new models and introduced a Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) architecture to its family of models, making them more efficient to serve.

In this course, you’ll work with two of the three new models introduced in Llama 4. First is “Maverick” a 400-billion parameter model, with 128 experts and 17 million active parameters. Second is “Scout,” a 109-billion parameter model with 16 experts and 17 billion active parameters. Both Maverick and Scout support long context windows, of up to a million tokens and 10 million tokens respectively. The latter is enough to support very large GitHub repos for analysis.

In hands-on lessons, you’ll build apps using Llama 4’s long-context and its new multi-modal capabilities including reasoning across multiple images and “image grounding,” in which you can identify elements and reason within specific image regions. You’ll also learn about Llama’s newest tools: its prompt optimization tool that automatically improves system prompts, and synthetic data kit that generates high-quality datasets to fine-tune your model.

Abstract:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically presumed to process context uniformly—that is, the model should handle the 10,000th token just as reliably as the 100th. However, in practice, this assumption does not hold. We observe that model performance varies significantly as input length changes, even on simple tasks.
In this report, we evaluate 18 LLMs, including the state-of-the-art GPT-4.1, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, and Qwen3 models. Our results reveal that models do not use their context uniformly; instead, their performance grows increasingly unreliable as input length grows.

Abstract:
Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking, have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific (e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2 Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters, FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2 Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance, suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently, EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling b', 'The video discusses a novel AI/ML architecture called Energy-Based Transformers (EBT) that learns to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and candidate predictions, allowing it to perform general "System 2 Thinking" capabilities without additional supervision or training.

GRPO is one of the core advancements used in Deepseek-R1, but was introduced already last year in this paper that uses a combination of new RL techniques and iterative data collection to achieve remarkable performance on mathematics benchmarks with just a 7B model.

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300

Abstract:
Mathematical reasoning poses a significant challenge for language models due to its complex and structured nature. In this paper, we introduce DeepSeekMath 7B, which continues pre-training DeepSeek-Coder-Base-v1.5 7B with 120B math-related tokens sourced from Common Crawl, together with natural language and code data. DeepSeekMath 7B has achieved an impressive score of 51.7% on the competition-level MATH benchmark without relying on external toolkits and voting techniques, approaching the performance level of Gemini-Ultra and GPT-4. Self-consistency over 64 samples from DeepSeekMath 7B achieves 60.9% on MATH. The mathematical reasoning capability of DeepSeekMath is attributed to two key factors: First, we harness the significant potential of publicly available web data through a meticulously engineered data selection pipeline. Second, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), that enhances mathematical reasoning abilities while concurrently optimizing the memory usage of PPO.

This paper does away with tokenization and creates an LLM architecture that operates on dynamically sized "patches" instead of tokens. By controlling the patch size, they gain a level of control over the tradeoff between model size and FLOPs and use that to achieve more favorable scaling behavior than classically tokenized LLMs.

Paper: https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/byte-latent-transformer-patches-scale-better-than-tokens/
Code: https://github.com/facebookresearch/blt

Abstract:
We introduce the Byte Latent Transformer (BLT), a new byte-level LLM architecture that, for the first time, matches tokenization-based LLM performance at scale with significant improvements in inference efficiency and robustness. BLT encodes bytes into dynamically sized patches, which serve as the primary units of computation. Patches are segmented dynamically based on the entropy of the next byte, allocating more compute and model capacity where increased data complexity demands it. We present the first flop controlled scaling study of byte-level models up to 8B parameters with 4T training bytes. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of scaling models trained on raw bytes without a fixed-vocabulary. Both training and inference efficiency improve due to dynamically selecting long patches when data is predictable, along with qualitative improvements on reasoning and long tail generalization. Overall, for fixed inference costs, BLT shows significantly better scaling than tokenization-based models, by simultaneously growing both patch and model size.

Paper: https://openreview.net/forum?id=6Mxhg9PtDE&s=09

Abstract:
The safety alignment of current Large Language Models (LLMs) is vulnerable. Simple attacks, or even benign fine-tuning, can jailbreak aligned models. We note that many of these vulnerabilities are related to a shared underlying issue: safety alignment can take shortcuts, wherein the alignment adapts a model''s generative distribution primarily over only its very first few output tokens. We unifiedly refer to this issue as shallow safety alignment. In this paper, we present case studies to explain why shallow safety alignment can exist and show how this issue universally contributes to multiple recently discovered vulnerabilities in LLMs, including the susceptibility to adversarial suffix attacks, prefilling attacks, decoding parameter attacks, and fine-tuning attacks. The key contribution of this work is that we demonstrate how this consolidated notion of shallow safety alignment sheds light on promising research directions for mitigating these vulnerabilities. We show that deepening the safety alignment beyond the first few tokens can meaningfully improve robustness against some common exploits. We also design a regularized fine-tuning objective that makes the safety alignment more persistent against fine-tuning attacks by constraining updates on initial tokens. Overall, we advocate that future safety alignment should be made more than just a few tokens deep.

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23168

Abstract:
Transformers have become the predominant architecture in foundation models due to their excellent performance across various domains. However, the substantial cost of scaling these models remains a significant concern. This problem arises primarily from their dependence on a fixed number of parameters within linear projections. When architectural modifications (e.g., channel dimensions) are introduced, the entire model typically requires retraining from scratch. As model sizes continue growing, this strategy results in increasingly high computational costs and becomes unsustainable. To overcome this problem, we introduce TokenFormer, a natively scalable architecture that leverages the attention mechanism not only for computations among input tokens but also for interactions between tokens and model parameters, thereby enhancing architectural flexibility. By treating model parameters as tokens, we replace all the linear projections in Transformers with our token-parameter attention layer, where input tokens act as queries and model parameters as keys and values. This reformulation allows for progressive and efficient scaling without necessitating retraining from scratch. Our model scales from 124M to 1.4B parameters by incrementally adding new key-value parameter pairs, achieving performance comparable to Transformers trained from scratch while greatly reducing training costs.
